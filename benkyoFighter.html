    An ambitious project, this one is going to take a while to make. Work began in August of 2021,
    and has been a side project, so development has been slow. Gameplay will be a combination of old school
    shoot 'em up action like in the Aleste series, and the more self-paced Pocky and Rocky series, but with some
    tweaks and alterations so that it can play optimally on the Master System. Once one exists, a demo will be
    available for download. Until, just sit back and enjoy your life!

    The Story
  </h3>
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
    The Benkyo Extraterrestrial Surveillance Organization (B.E.S.O.) has been conducting missions to find
    habitable environments on other worlds. The latest reports looks promising, and two Benkyo research vessels
    are sent to investigate the potential new home. However, on their descent into the atmosphere, they are shot down
    by an anti-aircraft missile from the planet's surface! The research vessels lose control in the planet's
    atmosphere, and are sent hurdling to the ground below. Equipped with only their on-board self defense systems,
    will they be able to find a way to get off of this planet and make it back home?

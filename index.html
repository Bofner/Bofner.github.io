            Who are we?

         <p>
             Steelfinger Studios is a (for now) one man video game development company. At the moment, all graphics and 
            programming are done by Cameron "Bofner" Mitchell. So far we have one game available, Triangle Puzzle for 
            the Sega Master System. We are hoping to create more content in the future, and are currently working on
            a couple of different projects that may or not come to fruition.

            I received my Bachelor's degree in physics from Clark University in 2018, and my 
            Master's degree in computer science at WPI in 2022. I'm most passionate about
            old technology, video games, and exercising my creativity. I find that a lot of
            games, art and media these days play it too safe and end up just churning out what
            companies know will sell. I strive to be creative in everything that I do, and hope
            that someday I'll be able to share my creativity with the rest of the world. 
            <br></br> 
            Whenever I make a project of my own, if I'm the only one that's working on the 
            prject, then I always try to make everything on my own. For instance, I designed
            the font used on this website. This has allowed me to dip my toes into the more 
            artistic side of game design and computer programming as well. I value a well
            rounded education and experience, and I've learned a lot from all of the little
            projects I've worked on over the years.
